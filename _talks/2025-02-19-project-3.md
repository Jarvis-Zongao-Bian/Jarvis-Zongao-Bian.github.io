# Building an AI-Powered Shopping Assistant: DealDetectiveAI

## **Introduction**
In today's fast-paced digital world, online shopping has become a daily activity for many. With countless retailers, fluctuating prices, and a vast selection of products, finding the best deals can be overwhelming. To address this, I developed **DealDetectiveAI**, an AI-powered shopping assistant that simplifies the online shopping experience by integrating **personalized recommendations, price comparisons, and AI-driven insights**.

In this blog, I will walk you through the inspiration, core features, tech stack, and development process behind DealDetectiveAI.

## **Why I Built DealDetectiveAI?**
Online shopping can be frustrating when:
- Prices vary across different retailers.
- There are too many options to choose from.
- Finding **personalized** recommendations is difficult.

DealDetectiveAI was created to solve these issues by:
- **Comparing prices** across multiple e-commerce platforms.
- **Providing AI-powered recommendations** based on user search history and browsing behavior.
- **Tracking price changes** so users can make informed purchase decisions.

## **Key Features**

### üõí **AI-Powered Product Recommendations**
Using **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4**, DealDetectiveAI generates personalized product recommendations based on the user's past searches and browsing history. This ensures that each user gets **tailored** shopping suggestions that match their needs and preferences.

### üí∞ **Price Comparison Across Retailers**
DealDetectiveAI fetches prices from multiple sources such as **Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy** using APIs and web scraping techniques. Users can see side-by-side price comparisons to ensure they get the best deals.

### üîç **Smart Search with AI Assistance**
The app features an intelligent search function that helps users quickly find relevant products while filtering out irrelevant or outdated listings.

### üìä **Real-Time Price Tracking** (Future Feature)
One of the planned enhancements is price tracking, where users can set alerts to get notified when a product's price drops.

## **Tech Stack Used**

### üé® **Frontend: React.js**
- **Why?** Fast, component-based UI development with seamless API integration.
- Used React Router for smooth navigation and Axios for fetching data.

### üîß **Backend: Node.js + Express**
- Handles API requests, AI interactions, and database queries.
- **OpenAI API** powers the recommendation engine.

### üóÑ **Database: PostgreSQL**
- Stores user browsing history and price data.
- Optimized queries to quickly fetch relevant shopping information.

### üõ† **Additional Tools & Libraries**
